# `stm32-template`

> A template for building applications for STM32 microcontrollers

## Dependencies

To build embedded programs using this template you'll need:

- The `cargo generate` subcommand. [Installation
  instructions](https://github.com/cargo-generate/cargo-generate#installation).
``` console
$ cargo install cargo-generate
```

- Flash and run/debug tools:
``` console
$ cargo install probe-rs --features cli
```

- `rust-std` components (pre-compiled `core` crate) for the ARM Cortex-M
  targets. Run:
  
``` console
$ rustup target add thumbv6m-none-eabi thumbv7m-none-eabi thumbv7em-none-eabi thumbv7em-none-eabihf
```

## Instantiate the template.

1. Run and enter project name
``` console
$ cargo generate --git https://github.com/burrbull/stm32-template/
 Project Name: app
```

2. Specify **chip product name** and answer on several other guide questions.

3. Your program is ready to compile:
``` console
$ cargo build --release
```

## Flash and run/debug

You can flash your firmware using one of those tools:

- `cargo flash --release` — just flash
- `cargo run --release` — flash and run using `probe-rs run` runner or `probe-run` runner (deprecated) which you can set in `.cargo/config.toml`
- `cargo embed --release` — multifunctional tool for flash and debug

You also can debug your firmware on device from VS Code with [probe-rs](https://probe.rs/docs/tools/vscode/) extention or with `probe-rs gdb` command.
You will need SVD specification for your chip for this. You can load patched SVD files [here](https://stm32-rs.github.io/stm32-rs/).
